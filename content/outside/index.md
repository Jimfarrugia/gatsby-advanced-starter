Outside is a single-page weather application I created using ReactJS.

I wanted to get my feet wet with React and also to utilize an external API to pull data from. The app makes requests to the current weather API from OpenWeatherMap.org and displays relevant information to the user.

React feels like an extremely powerful tool to use and I'm eagre to dive into more projects after I get a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.
