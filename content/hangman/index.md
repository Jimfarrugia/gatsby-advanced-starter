This is the first project I completed at code bootcamp. The assignment task was to work with a partner to create an interactive terminal application using the [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)) programming language.

[Natasha Khatri](https://github.com/tashk85) and I were partnered and we created an application for playing the game, [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).

Check out this [blog post](https://medium.com/@jim_farrugia/code-bootcamp-week-3-first-project-c912a9310c36) where I described my thoughts about the project after we'd finished.

Extensive documentation can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/Jimfarrugia/ruby_hangman).
