This is the first project I completed at code bootcamp. The assignment task was to work with a partner to create an interactive terminal application using the Ruby programming language.

[Natasha Khatri] and I were partnered and we created an application for playing the game, [Hangman].

Expand this project and checkout the demo video!

Check out this blog post where I described my thoughts about the project after we'd finished.

Extensive documentation can be found in the [Github repository].
