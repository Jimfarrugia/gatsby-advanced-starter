Crystal Jade is a Chinese Restaurant in St Clair, NSW.

This is one of my early projects where I designed and developed a single-page website to display their menu, opening hours and contact details.

I used this as an opportunity to get some of my first experience with CSS3 and jQuery by creating a fully collapsible/expandable takeout menu.
